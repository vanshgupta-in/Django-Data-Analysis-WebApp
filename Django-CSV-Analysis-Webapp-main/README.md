**Django Data Analysis Web Application**

This is a Django-based web application that allows users to upload CSV files, perform data analysis using pandas and numpy, and display the results and visualizations on the web interface.

**Goal of the Project**

The goal of this project is to create a web application that enables users to upload and analyze CSV files containing sales data. The application will provide various data analysis features, including summary statistics and data visualizations, to help users gain insights from their data.

**Analysis Approach**

**File Upload:** Users upload their CSV files containing sales data.

**Data Reading and Processing:** The uploaded CSV file is read using pandas. Basic data cleaning and preprocessing steps are performed.

**Summary Statistics:** The application calculates and displays summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.

**Missing Values:** The application identifies and handles missing values in the dataset.

**Data Visualization:** The application generates and displays basic plots, such as histograms, for numerical columns.

**Exploratory Data Analysis on Sales Data with Graphs**

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) focuses on understanding the structure and characteristics of the sales data. The following steps are typically included in the EDA:

**First Few Rows:** Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.

**Summary Statistics:** Calculate and display summary statistics for numerical columns.

**Missing Values:** Identify columns with missing values and determine appropriate handling strategies.

**Histograms:** Generate histograms for numerical columns to visualize the distribution of the data.
